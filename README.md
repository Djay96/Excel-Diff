# GitHub Project Execution Guide

## Introduction
This is a Python project designed to perform a comparison script. This documentation provides an overview of how to set up the environment, execute the script, and troubleshoot common issues.

## Prerequisites
Before executing the script, ensure that your environment meets the following requirements:

- Python 3.8 or higher installed.
- Required Python libraries: `openpyxl`, `tqdm`, `PyQt5`, `requests`, `pandas`.

You can install these dependencies using pip:

\`\`\`bash
pip install openpyxl tqdm PyQt5 requests pandas
\`\`\`

## Execution
To execute the script, follow these steps:

1. Open a terminal/command prompt.
2. Navigate to the directory where the script is located.
3. Run the script by typing `python github_project.py` (or `.\github_project.exe` if you are running the compiled version).

The script will then execute and perform the required operations.

## Troubleshooting

**Error: ModuleNotFoundError**

If you encounter a `ModuleNotFoundError`, it means that one or more of the required Python libraries are not installed. Install the missing libraries using pip (see Prerequisites section).

**Error: Script not executing**

If the script doesn't execute or you encounter any other error, verify that:
- Python is correctly installed and added to your system's PATH.
- All required Python libraries are installed.
- The script is not corrupted or modified.
